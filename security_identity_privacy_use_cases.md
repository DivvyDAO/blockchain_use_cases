#### There is a lot of mis-information about Blockchain and DLT (Distributed Ledger Technology). Intention of this use case document is to focus on Blockchain/DLT failures particularily in the areas of Data Security, Identity, Data Privacy, and non-repudiation. It should be noted that these use cases are the same use cases that have plagued all open networks since their inception.

1. Identity use cases

2. Data Security use cases

3. Data Privacy use cases

4. Non-repudiation
  1. 401k use case
    - Assuptions
      - Digital assets are purely virtual and live on the blockchain
      - User has a public key that contains the assets.
      - User has a matching private key used to create digital signatures to authorize movement of those assets.
      - Asset has no physical world connections. Its purely virtual.
    - Requirement
      - Loss of the private key should not mean 401k investment is gone.
    - Story
      - User has a 401k investment thats purely invested in a virtual assets, such as a virtual currency.
      - That asset has no phlives on a DLT.
  2. Malware use case
    - Assuptions
      - User has a public key that contains the assets.
      - User has a matching private key used to create digital signatures to authorize movement of those assets.
